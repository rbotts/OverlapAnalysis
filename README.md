# OverlapAnalysis
This repository contains a sample data set and some R code for performing Overlap Analysis on it.

Overlap analysis is a method for quantifying how much time two species in a region spend active concurrently. Our research is on some of the medium and large mammals in Costa Rica, using camera traps to measure the presence of the different species and assuming that higher detection rates imply higher activity (if they were inactive, they would not trigger any camera traps).
